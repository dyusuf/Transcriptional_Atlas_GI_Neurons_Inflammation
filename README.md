# Transcriptional Atlas of GI Neurons During Inflammation

This repository contains the scripts and analysis used in our study that explores the transcriptional landscape of gastrointestinal (GI) neurons during inflammation. It provides data and resources for reproducing the results.

## Repository Structure

### `analysis/`
- **Description**: Contains scripts for analyzing RNA-seq data, performing differential expression analysis, and generating plots. This includes data normalization, statistical tests, and pathway analysis.

### `data/`
- **Description**: Houses raw and processed data files, including RNA-seq count matrices and normalized count data for the analyses.

### `index.md`
- **Description**: The main documentation file that powers the GitHub Pages site with a detailed project overview.
