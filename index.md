# Transcriptional Atlas of GI Neurons During Inflammation

Welcome to the project repository for the **Transcriptional Atlas of Gastrointestinal (GI) Neurons During Inflammation**. This repository contains the code, data, and analysis associated with our manuscript, which aims to create a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of GI neurons in response to inflammatory conditions.

## RNA-seq analysis

A transcriptional atlas of gut-innervating neurons reveals activation of the interferon and ferroptosis pathway during intestinal inflammation.

### Key Components:
- **Raw Data**: RNA-Seq data used in the analysis.
- **Processed Data**: Normalized gene expression counts.
- **Analysis Scripts**: R scripts for differential gene expression and gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis.
- **Results**: HTML reports generated from the RMarkdown files for visualization and interpretation.

## Available Resources

### Data
- **[Raw Data](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/tree/main/data/raw/)**: Contains raw RNA-seq count data used for the analyses.
- **[Processed Data](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/tree/main/data/processed)**: Includes normalized count data, making it easier for replication and further analysis.

### Analysis
Each analysis report is available in HTML format and can be viewed below:

- [DRG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/DRG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [ENS GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/ENS_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [SMG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/SMG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [VG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/VG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)


## Instructions to Reproduce
You can reproduce the analysis by running the following RMarkdown files:
- **[DRG Analysis](analysis/DRG_DGE_GO_Analysis.Rmd)**
- **[ENS Analysis](analysis/ENS_DGE_GO_Analysis.Rmd)**
- **[SMG Analysis](analysis/SMG_DGE_GO_Analysis.Rmd)**
- **[VG Analysis](analysis/VG_DGE_GO_Analysis.Rmd)**


## Protein Network Analysis

In addition to the transcriptional analysis, we have also performed protein network analysis to understand the interactions and pathways involved in the inflammatory response of GI neurons.

### Key Components:
- **Protein Interaction Data**: Data used for constructing the protein interaction network.
- **Analysis Scripts**: R scripts for protein network analysis.
- **Results**: HTML reports generated from the RMarkdown files for visualization and interpretation.

### Available Resources

- **[Protein Interaction Data](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/tree/main/data/protein_interaction/)**: Contains the network data generated by AxoWise used in the manuscript.
- **[Protein Network Analysis Report](analysis/Protein_Network_Analysis.html)**: HTML report generated from the RMarkdown file for protein network analysis.

## Instructions to Reproduce
1. **Performe network analysis with AxoWise**: Use the AxoWise online tool to explore the protein interaction network and functiona network.
2. **Map Protein Clusters Against Selected Pathways**: Run the following RMarkdown file to map protein clusters against selected pathways:
   - **[Map Protein Clusters](analysis/Map_Protein_Clusters.Rmd)**
