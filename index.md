title: "Transcriptional Atlas of GI Neurons During Inflammation"
---

Welcome to the project repository for the **Transcriptional Atlas of Gastrointestinal (GI) Neurons During Inflammation**. This repository contains the code, data, and analysis associated with our manuscript, which aims to create a comprehensive transcriptional atlas of GI neurons in response to inflammatory conditions.

You can view the project on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation).

## RNA-seq analysis

A transcriptional atlas of gut-innervating neurons reveals activation of the interferon and ferroptosis pathway during intestinal inflammation.

### Data
- **[Raw Data](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/tree/main/data/raw/)**: Contains raw RNA-seq count data used for the analyses.
- **[Processed Data](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/tree/main/data/processed)**: Includes normalized count data, making it easier for replication and further analysis.

### Analysis
Each analysis report is available in HTML format and can be viewed below:

- [DRG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/DRG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [ENS GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/ENS_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [SMG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/SMG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)
- [VG GO Term Enrichment Analysis](analysis/VG_DGE_GO_Analysis.html)


### Instructions to Reproduce

You can reproduce the analysis by downloading our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dyusuf/Transcriptional_Atlas_GI_Neurons_Inflammation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and running the RMarkdown files located in the `analysis` folder.

## Protein Network Analysis

In addition to the transcriptional analysis, we performed a comprehensive protein network analysis to explore the interactions and pathways involved in the inflammatory response of GI neurons. For more details and specific use cases, please refer to the [AxoWIse user case description]().
